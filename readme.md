# Welcome to Job Search App

There are 2 Directories and 1 Database Collection File In The Job Search App Directory

  # Please Note :-
  Before Starting The App and The Server Please Install Node Modules Directories in Both (frontend and backend) Directories,
  as the Node Modules Directories are not provided in these directories, because it will increase the file size beyond the upload limits.

 1. Frontend :-
Open the frontend directory in any IDE and then just start the app from the terminal using command :-
     npm start
 2. Backend :-
 Open the backend directory in any IDE and then just start the server from the terminal using command :-
    node server.js
   
Database Collection File :-
 As Database MongoDB is used.
  There is a Database Collection Json file in the main directory.
  YourHR-Database.collections.json :- It can be direcly imported to any MongoDB Database. there is a already database url in backend which can be used as it is, without creating a new one. 

# The Online Deployed App 
The Job Search App is deployed in Github and vercel.
It works great, but in the online deployed app everything works, except the file upload system, as the app deployed using Github and Vercel which are good for static file and the file system is dynamic file upload system so that's why the online deployed app work with the features like signup, login, logout etc. but not the file upload system. 
      
      All the features including file upload system works great without any issue in the Local Machine.
